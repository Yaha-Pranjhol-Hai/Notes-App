# Notes-App

The project I built is “Note Taking Website App Using Pure JavaScript.” We all have a notes app on our mobiles or laptop. Note-taking websites are the online equivalent of notebooks, and because they are digital, they can do more for you than paper ever could. You can even build a more advanced level note-taking website, but I kept it simple for now, as it is my first project!

The project setup is really simple. Because it only uses JavaScript without any frameworks.

I used Bootstrap as it is used for applying styling the user interface components.Bootstrap is bundled with many components that can be used to provide good user experience and user interactions in a web page like cards, navigation bars, dropdowns, icons, buttons, forms and also sizing options for different DOM elements. In this project, I used bootstrap components for making the front end of the website.

If you like my work, then keep supporting and stay up to date with Yahan-Pranjhol-hai.
